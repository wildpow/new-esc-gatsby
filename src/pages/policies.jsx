      <Heading>365 Day Comfort Guarantee</Heading>
      <P>
        It will take anywhere from 30 to 90 nights for your new mattress to
        break in and for your body to adjust to the new support and comfort.
        Because of this, we require that you sleep on your new mattress for a
        minimum of 30 nights to allow for adjustment. However, if you are not
        comfortable within 90 days of your original mattress’s delivery date,
        you may exchange or return your mattress one time in this period.
      </P>
      <P>
        Delivery and set up fees are non-refundable. We do not charge restocking
        fees, only a redelivery fee of $79.99. E.S.C. Mattress Center is unable
        to exchange or refund any mattress that is stained, soiled, or in any
        way damaged under this guarantee. Do not remove the Law Label from your
        mattress or foundation, doing so will void your 365 Day Comfort
        Guarantee. Any mattress purchase $699 and above also receives an
        additional 275 days of exchange only guarantee for equal or greater
        value (total of 365 day). Please be aware that our Comfort Guarantee
